## 🌟 About the Project  
This is a **full-stack web application** built to showcase my skills as a developer.  
The idea: a platform where people in **Mostar** (and later other cities) can **offer or search for services** – from small tasks and freelance jobs to professional services.  

The project is also part of my **portfolio** to demonstrate coding quality, structure, and the ability to deliver complete solutions.

## ✨ Demo Preview  
📸 *Screenshots will be added here once the UI pages are polished.*  

- **Login Page** – User authentication with JWT  
- **Register Page** – Create an account and join the platform  
- **Future Pages** – Service listing, profile management, messaging system

## 🚀 Features Implemented So Far  

### 🔐 Backend (Node.js + Express)  
- API server with Express  
- MongoDB connection with Mongoose

- Password encryption with bcrypt  
- `.env` configuration for sensitive data  

### 🎨 Frontend (Vue.js 3 + Tailwind)
