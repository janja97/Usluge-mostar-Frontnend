## 🌟 About the Project  
**Usluge Mostar** is a **full-stack web application** built to demonstrate my skills as a developer.  

The idea: a platform where people in **Mostar** (and later other cities) can **offer or search for services** – from simple tasks and freelance work to professional services.  

This project is also part of my **portfolio** to show clean code, structure, and complete full-stack delivery.

## ✨ Demo Preview  
📸 *Screenshots will be added once the UI pages are polished.*  

- **Login Page** – Secure authentication with JWT  
- **Register Page** – New user account creation  
- **Upcoming Pages** – Service listing, filters, user profiles, messaging system

## 🚀 Features Implemented So Far  

### 🔐 Backend (Node.js + Express)  
- API server with Express  
- MongoDB connection via Mongoose  
- **User authentication** (Register/Login with JWT)  
- Password hashing with bcrypt  
- `.env` support for secrets (JWT, MongoDB URI, PORT)  

### 🎨 Frontend (Vue.js 3 + TailwindCSS)  
- Vue Router setup for navigation  
- **Login Page** – error handling + JWT storage in `localStorage`  
- **Register Page** – ready with form validation  
- Axios integrated for API communication  
- TailwindCSS fully configured (light mode by default)  
- **Service Filters** with `vue-slider-component` for price range (min/max slider)

## 🎯 Next Steps  
- Profile page (view/update user info)  
- Create, update & browse services  
- Role-based features (providers vs. seekers)  
- Improved UI (Tailwind components, animations, responsiveness)  
- Messaging system between users  
- Deployment:  
  - Frontend → Netlify  
  - Backend → Render / Railway / Heroku
